            <pre style="text-align: center;">
Did I adore her?

Or was it the spark in her eyes

that lit up my world?

Did I adore her?

Or was it the way she brightens up my day

with just one smile?

Did I adore her?

Or was it the way she makes me laugh,

like the sunshine that chases away the clouds?

Did I adore her?

Or was it the way she always knows how to make me feel better, like a calm in every storm?

Did I adore her?

Or was it the way she challenges me

to be my best self, like a partner in a beautiful dance?

Did I adore her?

Or was it some cosmic plan to bring us together, to create a love that's simply meant to be?

Did I adore her?

Or was it all about the joy that we share,

and the love that's still growing?
