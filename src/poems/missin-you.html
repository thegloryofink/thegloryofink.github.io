            <pre style="text-align: center;">
It was a good run,

We had a lot of fun.

I am missing you a lot,

After that tough war we just fought.

Being without you is a pain,

I have more loss then gain.

Madam, you took my heart away,

Nothing left for people to play.

I can't stop thinking about you,

Hoping you'd come out of the blue.

But I believe in a new route,

Where seeds we plant will have to sprout.
