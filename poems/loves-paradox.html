            <h2>Love's Paradox</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
I'm with you, but I'm alone, 

Together forever, but never home.

We're far apart, but very close too,

Missing you, but feeling you.

I'm lost with you, but I'm found, 

n your eyes, but never around.

Our love's a yes, but it's a no,

Forever with you, but I don't know.

I'm full of you, but I'm empty too,

Having you, but not having you.

You're always mine, but never here,

Forever near, but far from near.
