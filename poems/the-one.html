            <pre style="text-align: center;">
You mean everything to me,

My heart beats for you, can't you see?

I love you so much, it's hard to say,

But being with you is where I want to stay.

You're my sunshine, my guiding light,

You make my world a better sight.

I'll do whatever it takes to make you mine,

'Cause with you, my love, everything feels divine.

You're the one I think of every night,

The one I want to wake up to, and make things right.

I love you more with each passing day,

And I promise to love you, in every way.
