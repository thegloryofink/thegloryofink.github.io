            <h2>Fade of Love</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
                She was once a shining star to me,

                Her presence in my life is now history.

                She once lit up my life with her grace,

                But now her light has faded from its place.

                She once held a special place in my heart,

                She's now a memory that I'll never restart.

                Our love has now faded, torn apart,

                Leaving me with just a shattered heart.

                I'm moving on now, leaving our past behind,

                Finding my way, one step at a time as I find.

                A new chapter unfolds, a new story unassigned,

                And hope revives, a heart that's redefined.
