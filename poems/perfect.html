            <pre style="text-align: center;">
Whatever happens, don't you worry or fear,

I'll be here for you, and we'll be clear.

I'll manage it all, with a heart so true,

For you, my Perfect, I'll see us through.

The time we share, I'll cherish every day,

And hold it close, in a special way.

You're mine forever, my love so bright,

With you, my Perfect, everything's alright.

In your eyes, my heart finds a peaceful place,

With you, I'll share a love that time won't erase.

Through life's ups and downs, I'll stand by your side,

Forever with you, my Perfect, I'll abide.
