            <h2>A Lifetime Promise</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
As I stand before you, my heart beats fast,

A question I must ask, that will forever last.

I've searched for the right words, to express my heart's desire,

To spend forever with you, my love, my soul on fire.

Your smile, your laugh, your eyes, they shine so bright,

A treasure to behold, a precious delight.

With every passing day, my love for you grows strong,

Forever with you, is where I belong.

Will you be my partner, my friend, my guiding star?

Will you marry me, and travel near and far?

I promise to love you, through joy and through tears,

Forever and always, my love, for a thousand years.
