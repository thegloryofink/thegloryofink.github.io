            <pre style="text-align: center;">
I know I won't see you again,

This will be a path of pain.

The pain is not new, I can cope,

But I will always have hope.

I might sleep forever,

Hoping we were together.

Look up the sky at night,

I will be a star pretty bright.

We had the same trait,

I guess being together not in our fate.

But know I love you,

And my love sure is true.

Sometimes I think I am hallucinating,

Then it turns out to be nothing.

Now I am all alone,

Destroyed are all the seeds we sown.
