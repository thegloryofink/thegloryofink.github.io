            <h2>Hearts Adrift</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
In love, we once did intertwine,

Our hearts, like stars, used to shine.

But now it's time to say goodbye,

With tears in every sigh.

Our paths diverge, our love does wane,

No more to share the sun or rain.

Though it hurts, we must part,

To find new journeys and a fresh start.

The memories we made, I'll keep,

In my heart, they'll forever sleep.

Though we part with heavy hearts and pain,

Our love's sweet echo will remain.

Farewell, my love, we'll find our way,

In different dawns of a brand new day.

As we embrace a world unknown,

We'll heal and grow, each on our own.

Always know I will be here,

In your laugh or your tear.

But don't look me in the eye,

Turn back, and say goodbye.
