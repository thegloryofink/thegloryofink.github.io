            <h2>You</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
You were the only one,

We had a lot of fun.

We laughed, we cried,

Until those tears dried.

But now you are lost,

Leaving me in this desert of frost.

I try hard to find you,

Hoping you'd show out of the blue.

You were my everything,

You left and then there was nothing.

In the silence, echoes our past,

A void within, a love that didn't last.
