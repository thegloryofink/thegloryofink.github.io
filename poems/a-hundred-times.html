            <pre style="text-align: center;">
A hundred times, I spoke from my heart,

Longing for her love, a brand new start.

But every time, she'd shake her head and walk away,

Leaving me wondering, night and day.

The 101st time, I took a deep breath,

And asked again, with an open heart.

And to my surprise, she smiled so bright,

And said "I love you" â€” and made everything right.

Her words were music to my ears,

And filled my heart with happy tears.

The 101st time was the charm that worked,

And our love story finally emerged.
