            <h2>Breaking the Silence</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
I was shy, and didn't know what to say,

Afraid to talk, in a nervous way.

My heart was racing, with butterflies too,

I didn't know what to do.

But then I spoke, and felt so free,

Our words connected, happily.

My fears went away, and fun began,

We talked and laughed, with joy in hand.
