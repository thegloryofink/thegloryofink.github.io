            <h2>Perfect Together</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
We dance in the rain, and sing with glee,

Happy moments, just you and me.

We cook together, and play some games,

Our time together, is always the same.

We study hard, and watch movies too,

Listen to songs, that we love to do.

We lie in grass, and feel so free,

Perfect moments, just you and me.

We play the guitar, and sing with delight,

Wear the same clothes, and feel just right.

Our love shines bright, in every way,

Perfect together, every single day.
