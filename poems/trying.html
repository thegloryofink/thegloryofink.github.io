            <h2>Trying</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
I guess I tried too hard,

To fix my heart's shard.

But I guess I was wrong,

Our story ended at the title of the song.

We can't be together,

That dream is lost forever.

But I will keep trying,

Even if it leads to me dying.

I promised I'd never leave you,

I will make sure this holds true.

When you do leave me,

I shall set my soul free.
