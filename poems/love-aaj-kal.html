            <pre style="text-align: center;">
When they were young, he would call her on the phone,

Tell her silly cute jokes in a nervous tone.

He would talk of simple things, like you and me,

And wonder if she felt the same as he.

Many years later, many stories they share,

He sits beside her in the evening air.

They dont talk much, their words have lost grace,

He knows she is together, it is a beautiful place.

Back then, their dates, a simple evening walk,

They'd sit and listen to each other talk.

She'd hold his hand, a simple, gentle squeeze,

A feel, a thrill, in every single breeze.

Now, they sit and watch the clouds turn,

And share the lessons they have learned.

A knowing smile is all they need,

This love grew from that tiny seed.
