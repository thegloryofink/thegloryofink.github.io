            <h2>Only if..</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
On top of the mountain,

In front of that fountain.

I can't get you out of my mind,

In these valleys is you I find.

Only if you'd be here,

Taking away all my fear.

We could have taken some pics candid,

But you left me stranded.

We could have sat around the bonfire,

Filling up on hearts desire.

We could have done so much together,

That dream is lost forever.

We could have splashed in water,

Ending every single torture.

Drowned our sorrows in it,

Destroying it all bit by bit.
