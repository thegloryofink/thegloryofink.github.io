            <h2>Priyalekha</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
When my eyes whisper words on paper,

It's you I'm thinking of, with every thought and after.

In every line, a piece of my heart,

A message just for us to never part.

You're the one I think of, morning till night,

With every thought, a gentle delight.

With you, my heart feels a sense of home,

A feeling that's hard to put into words, but I'm never alone.

With every word, I share a piece of me,

Hoping you'll feel the emotions that let me free.

You're the one I cherish, always true,

Forever with you, my heart beats anew.
