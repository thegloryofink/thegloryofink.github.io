            <h2>What Is Love</h2>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
Love is a strange, crazy thing,

It makes my heart sing.

It brings me joy and pain so true,

A feeling that's hard to get through.

It makes me feel lost and alone,

A mix of emotions I've never known.

But still I want it every day,

And hope to find on my way.

It's a feeling that's really hard to define,

A mix of the heart and mind.

It makes me feel alive and free,

A love that's meant for you and me.
